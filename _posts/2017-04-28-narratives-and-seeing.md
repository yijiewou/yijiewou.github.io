I had spent several days pondering what kind of narrative can convey how deeply I was touched and affected over three months of field research in Taoist shrines, when the news came that the British author John Berger had died.

Berger had long been a source of inspiration for my writing. His thought-provoking narrative style often occupies my thoughts. When I take breaks from my own writing, I like to gaze out of my window and imagine seeing Berger write in his home in the Paris suburbs.

“The way we see things is affected by what we know or what we believe.”—John Berger, Ways of Seeing

I often thought of this Berger quote when I was in the field. When I sat at the same table as a priest in a shrine, I always found myself having to hide the rapturous joy I felt. I had wanted to be part of a scene like this for so long. This fascinating man sitting right before my eyes was a living embodiment of Taiwan’s history of Taoism. His face, his body, his eyes—all told a story much richer than words.

And so I continued to gaze, with my own unique way of seeing.

My way of seeing grows from my experiences in my thirty-plus years of life. My memories of my father and grandfather as a child. My feelings of loss and discovery as an adolescent. The passion and thirst I felt for culture when I studied in Paris. The unfamiliar foreign language and the intense loneliness. The warmth of a glance exchanged, the moments of connection in love. The birth of my daughter, the sudden death of my mother. Every minute, every second, every moment that blossoms in life…

Every unique way of seeing creates a unique narrative. It gives dimension to life and clarity to its context. I am certain that it is worthwhile to keep asking questions and keep writing about the same person and the same story. There is no best version, because every version forms a part of the perfect version that cannot be taken away.

“We never look at just one thing; we are always looking at the relation between things and ourselves.”—John Berger, Ways of Seeing
